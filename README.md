# User Storage

**JavaScript, React, NodeJS**

User Storage allows the application user to store character data. This software uses JavaScript with react to generate a front-end web interface to store user data (people and jobs) into the database, generating a unique ID for each individual. On the backend, Express.Js is used with HTTP calls to communicate and send information from the front-end into the Mongoose Data Base.

* Utilized npm from Node.js to run the application, ensuring efficient server-side execution.
* Developed the frontend using React with JavaScript and constructed a REST API as a crucial component of the backend using Express.js, communicating with HTTP calls.
* Initially utilized State and Props for frontend data management, but evolved the application to integrate MongoDB, enabling secure storage of user data and eliminating the need for an internal in-memory user list.
